## Nice to meet you!
My name is Chatdanai Lumdee, or 'Tua'. I am a native Thai grew up in [Phitsanulok](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Phitsanulok,+Nai+Mueang,+Mueang+Phitsanulok+District,+Phitsanulok+65000,+Thailand/@11.8104278,100.9371339,5.71z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x30df97e77e746631:0x371aaafbdf6cd038!8m2!3d16.8211238!4d100.2658516), a city 400 km to the north of Bangkok. During high school, my sister gave me a book, [The Next Big Thing Is Really Small](https://www.amazon.com/Next-Thing-Really-Small-Nanotechnology/dp/1400046890), which initiated my interest nanoscience. This serves as a reference point leading to my career in the field where I later developed a specialty in nanophotonics.

After some years of PhD in Florida and postdoc in Sweden, I grew a keen interest in data science. Following some time of self-studying and conducting small [personal projects]({{ site.url }}/codes), I decided to join and get a flavor of this fast growing field.

I embarked on the field as a data scientist at [Kasikorn Business-Technology Group (KBTG)](http://www.kbtg.tech/en) in Bangkok, Thailand. The company is part of [Kasikornbank (KBank)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasikornbank) that has been entrusted to act as a developer and to work in partnership with FinTech firms and tech-startups to explore financial innovations.

I then joined ASEAN [Accenture Applied Intelligence](https://www.accenture.com/th-en/applied-intelligence-index) within [Accenture Digital](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/digital-index). The mission of the team is to apply big data and analytics expertises to help businesses, organizations, and governments redefine how they serve connected customers and operate their connected enterprises.

Currently, I work as a data analyst at [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&cid=1888171), one of the fastest-growing online hotel platforms and is part of [Booking Holdings Inc](https://www.bookingholdings.com/). At Agoda, we believe that travel opens minds to new ideas, cultures and ways of thinking. Our mission is to make travel affordable, accessible and easily available to customers around the world.

I am always open for opportunities that I can use my skills in either nanophotonics or data science to help drive your projects. Please feel free to drop a message.


## Research careers in nanotechnology, optics, and photonics
It started when I graduated from the Faculty of Engineering, [Chulalongkorn University](http://www.chula.ac.th/en/) in Thailand with a major in nano engineering. I then took a fellowship from [CREOL/The College of Optics and Photonics](http://www.creol.ucf.edu/) in Orlando, FL to join a PhD program at one of the worldâ€™s foremost institutions for research and education in optics and photonics. At CREOL, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Pieter G. Kik](http://kik.creol.ucf.edu/) where my research focused on optical phenomena at the nanoscale. Upon completion of the degree, I decided to continue my postdoctoral training in another continent and joined a group led by [Prof. Alexandre Dmitriev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uFM2fgcAAAAJ) at [the University of Gothenburg](http://www.gu.se/english)/[Chalmers](http://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) in Sweden. I worked on a highly collaborative [EU project](http://www.physics.gu.se/english/research/femtoterabyte) with the aim to develop a technological platform for the next generation of data storage units through nano-optics and nanomagnetism.
