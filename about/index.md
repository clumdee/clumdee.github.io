## Nice to meet you!

My name is Chatdanai Lumdee, or 'Tua'. I am a native Thai grew up in [Phitsanulok](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Phitsanulok,+Nai+Mueang,+Mueang+Phitsanulok+District,+Phitsanulok+65000,+Thailand/@11.8104278,100.9371339,5.71z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x30df97e77e746631:0x371aaafbdf6cd038!8m2!3d16.8211238!4d100.2658516), a city 400 km to the north of Bangkok. During high school, my sister gave me a book, [The Next Big Thing Is Really Small](https://www.amazon.com/Next-Thing-Really-Small-Nanotechnology/dp/1400046890), which initiated my interest nanoscience. This serves as a reference point leading to my career in the field where I later developed a specialty in nanophotonics.

After some years of PhD in Florida and postdoc in Sweden, I grew a keen interest in data science. Following some time of teaching myself and conducting a few [personal projects]({{ site.url }}/codes), I decided to make a career switch.

Currently, I am a data scientist at [Kasikorn Business-Technology Group (KBTG)](http://www.kbtg.tech/en) in Bangkok, Thailand. The company is part of [Kasikornbank (KBank)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasikornbank) that has been entrusted to act as a developer and to work in partnership with FinTech firms and tech-startups to explore financial innovations.


## Research careers in nanotechnology, optics, and photonics
It started when I graduated from the Faculty of Engineering, [Chulalongkorn University](http://www.chula.ac.th/en/) in Thailand with a major in nano engineering. I then took a fellowship from [CREOL/The College of Optics and Photonics](http://www.creol.ucf.edu/) in Orlando, FL to join a PhD program at one of the world’s foremost institutions for research and education in optics and photonics. At CREOL, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Pieter G. Kik](http://kik.creol.ucf.edu/) where my research focused on optical phenomena at the nanoscale. Upon completion of the degree, I decided to continue my postdoctoral training in another continent and joined a group led by [Prof. Alexandre Dmitriev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uFM2fgcAAAAJ) at [the University of Gothenburg](http://www.gu.se/english)/[Chalmers](http://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) in Sweden. I worked on, and still give technical support to, a highly collaborative [EU project](http://www.physics.gu.se/english/research/femtoterabyte) with the aim to develop a technological platform for the next generation of data storage units through nano-optics and nanomagnetism.
