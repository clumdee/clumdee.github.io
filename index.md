## Hello there :)

Thank you for dropping by. As you stumbled upon this site, I presume you are on a track to learn something new. I hope the contents provided here could be useful to you.

On this page I blog [articles]({{ site.url }}/blog) that reflect thoughts at certain stages of life such as graduation and experiencing new culture. I also write about [projects in data science]({{ site.url }}/codes) describing motivations, fundamental concepts, and logic behind. The projects range from [data exploration]({{ site.url }}/blog/thailand-wages-by-occupation_full-code), [blockchain]({{ site.url }}/blog/blockchain-DIY-with-python), [recommender systems]({{ site.url }}/blog/recommender-system-with-python), [twitter streaming]({{ site.url }}/blog/idol-popularity-monitoring/), and [cloud platform]({{ site.url }}/blog/your-weather-station-with-azure-part1/).

If you are interested in nanoscience, then you can check out some of my [talks]({{ site.url }}/talks) in the topic of nanophotonics. Fun physics/optics demos are also available. We currently have [Optical Reflectance and Transmittance with Transfer-Matrix Method]({{ site.url }}/blog/optical-reflectance-transmittance-transfer-matrix/) and [Quantum Well Solver for Energy States and Electron Wavefunctions]({{ site.url }}/blog/quantum-well-solver/).

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. I look forward to learning from you.

Let the fun begin ~
