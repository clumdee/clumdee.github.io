## Near-field optical chirality

Optical chirality comes in forms of circular polarizations: left-handed or right-handed. Achiral light i.e. linearly polarized light can gain optical chirality through interacting with chiral media such as chiral molecules. The effect can be observed with techniques such as [circular dichroism spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dichroism)

Although not being able to induce far-field chirality to light, a symmetric optical antenna can create localized field of optical chirality.

## Calculating chiral near-field

The following code calculates and plots 3-dimensional distribution of chiral optical near-field generated by two orthogonal electric dipoles when excited by an electromagnetic field.

Two categories of the incident field can be used:
* Linearly polarized
* Elliptically polarized with \\(E_y\\) has 90deg phase lag with respect to \\(E_x\\).

In both cases, the relative magnitude of \\(E_x\\) and \\(E_y\\) can be adjusted by changing the angle *\\(\psi\\) (psi)*, with respect to the x-axis *i.e.* \\(E_x\sim\cos(\psi)\\) and \\(E_y\sim\sin(\psi)\\).

The code was developed based on two articles: [M. Schaferling, OptEx 2012](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-20-24-26326) and [T. J. Davis, PhyRevB 2013](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.085405).


#### Import libraries
The *chital_local* function is home-written and is provided [here]({{ site.url }}/blog/nearfield-optical-chirality_note).

```python
%matplotlib notebook

import numpy as np
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
# the function excludes intrinsic chiral field from the incident field
from chiral_local import chiral_local
```

#### Set parameters for the incident electromagnetic field
The necessary parameters are passed to the calculation as ***incWave***.


```python
# define the incident electric field's parameters

freq = 500e12              # set the frequency of the incident field e.g. 500 THz (600nm wavelength)
omega = 2*np.pi*freq
c = 3e8                    # speed of light in m/s
k = omega/c               
psiDeg = -45               # e.g. set psiDeg=45 to have |E_x|=|E_y|, changing the sign (+ or -) results in changing the handedness when using an elliptically incident field
psi = psiDeg/180*np.pi

incWave=[k, psi]
```

#### Define parameters for two electric dipoles
\\(p_x\\) and \\(p_y\\) are the strength, \\(A_x\\) and \\(A_y\\) are constants that depend on the plasma frequency, \\(\omega_{res,x}\\) and \\(\omega_{res,y}\\) are the resonance frequencies, and \\(\Gamma_x\\) and \\(\Gamma_y\\) are the loss terms of the dipoles. For more details, please find the notions in [T. J. Davis, PhyRevB 2013](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.085405).

For simplicity, the y-dipole is set to zero in this example. The resulting plot resembles what shown in Figure 2 of [T. J. Davis, PhyRevB 2013](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.085405).


```python
## define parameters

# x-dipole
p_x = 1
A_x = 1
omegaRes_x = omega
Gamma_x = 0.5*omegaRes_x
deltaOmega_x = omega - omegaRes_x
beta_x = A_x*p_x**2/(deltaOmega_x**2 + Gamma_x**2/4)
xDipole = [beta_x,Gamma_x,deltaOmega_x]

# y-dipole
p_y = 0
A_y = 1*A_x
omegaRes_y = omega
Gamma_y = 0.1*omegaRes_y
deltaOmega_y = omega - omegaRes_y
beta_y = A_y*p_y**2/(deltaOmega_y**2 + Gamma_y**2/4)
yDipole = [beta_y,Gamma_y,deltaOmega_y]

```

#### Set plot volume

```python
## set plot volume

[xlim, ylim, zlim] = [2, 2, 2]
[nx, ny, nz] = [41, 41, 41]

x,y,z = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-xlim,xlim,nx), np.linspace(-ylim,ylim,ny), np.linspace(-zlim,zlim,nz))
x = x.flatten()
y = y.flatten()
z = z.flatten()

r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)

# define position in a spherical coordinate (r, tetha, phi)
position=[r, np.arcsin(z/r), np.arctan2(y,x)]
```


#### Calculate localized optical chiral field, make sure to select the correct mode!

```python
# perform calculation

c_local = np.zeros_like(position[0])
mode = 'linear'

for i in range(position[0].size):
    pos = [position[0][i],position[1][i],position[2][i]]
    c_local[i] = chiral_local(incWave, xDipole, yDipole, pos, mode)    
```


#### 3D interactive plot in ipython/Jupyter notebook

```python
# plot

scale=omega
colorLim = 5/omega

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
s_set = 150*np.log10((np.abs(c_local*omega)))    # scale the size of scatter points to improve visibility, note the log scale
p = ax.scatter(x, y, z, c=c_local, edgecolor=(0,0,0,0), s=s_set, cmap='jet', vmin=-colorLim, vmax=colorLim, depthshade=False)
fig.colorbar(p).set_label('chiral-nearfield', fontsize=15)

# axis labels
title_set = ('Near field optical chirality (c-field): ' + str(c_local.size) + ' data points')
ax.set_title(title_set, fontsize = 14)
ax.set_xlabel('x position', fontsize=10)
ax.set_ylabel('y position', fontsize=10)
ax.set_zlabel('z position', fontsize=10)
ax.tick_params(labelsize=10)

# axis limits
boxlim = 1.5
ax.set_xlim([-boxlim,boxlim])
ax.set_ylim([-boxlim,boxlim])
ax.set_zlim([-boxlim,boxlim])

# set initial viewing angles in degree
ax.view_init(elev=45, azim=45)

```
