## Introduction

We developed an interactive demo that calculates solutions of 1-D [Schr√∂dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation). These solutions represent energy states and electron wavefunctions of a 1-D quantum confinement structure, such as a [quantum well (QW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_well). The calculation is based on [*finite difference method*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method).

The demo allows a user to define essential parameters of a QW to solve. For example, width and energy levels of the conduction band of materials. Once solved, available energy states and electron wavefunctions of a QW are presented in an interactive format.

We hope the demo can help students, as well as professionals, to improve their understanding of quantum confinement effects.

## Demo

Click below to launch an interactive demo notebook on [binder](https://mybinder.org/).  
*The demo is written in Python. Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/clumdee/quantum_well_solver).*

*Core part of the code came from this [class project](https://clumdee.github.io/talks/talks-pdf/2010-05-XX_ClassProject_NumerModelRectQD.pdf).
For those with technical interests, we used this [paper](https://github.com/clumdee/quantum_well_solver/blob/master/1990_JAP_Schrodinger-Poisson.pdf) as a reference.*
